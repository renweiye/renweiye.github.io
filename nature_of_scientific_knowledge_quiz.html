<ol>
    <li><u>An important component of the scientific process is that the findings of science are</u></li>
    <p><a>(A)__</a>absolute.</p>
    <p><a title="Correct! The scientific process is a way of building knowledge and making predictions about the world in such a way that they are testable. Different scientific fields may use different methods to investigate the natural world, but testing lies at the heart of all scientific inquiry.">(B)__</a>testable.</p>
    <p><a>(C)__</a>true.</p>
    <p><a>(D)__</a>uncertain.</p>


    <li><u>We could be certain that the Earth was round only after pictures of the planet were taken from space in 1968.</u></li>
        <p><a>(A)__</a>true</p>
    <p><a title="Correct! Greek philosophers referred to the Earth as a sphere as early as the 6th century BCE. An accumulation of evidence over the following centuries confirmed that the Earth was round long before astronauts sent pictures of Earth from space in 1968, and even long before explorers sailed around the world in 1522.
">(B)__</a>false</p>
       
    <li><u>How did the Second Law of Thermodynamics contribute to our understanding of the age of the universe?</u></li>
            <p><a title="Correct! The second law of thermodynamics states that energy always flows from a high energy state to a low energy state (hot to cold) through entropy. If the universe was infinite, all of the energy within the universe would have been lost to entropy by now. In other words, the stars themselves would have burned out long ago. Since there are still active stars, we can conclude that the universe has existed for a finite amount of time.">(A)__</a>It suggested that the universe must be finite in age.</p>
        
        <p><a>(B)__</a>It suggested that the universe is infinitely old.</p>
        <p><a>(C)__</a>It suggested that the universe must be finite in size.</p>
        <p><a>(D)__</a>It suggested that the universe is contracting.</p>

    <li><u>Study the line spectra in Section 1 of the image. This spectrum represents the normal emission lines for elements traditionally found in stars (H, He, Ca, Na, etc.). The two sets of line spectra in Section 2 represent the observed spectra for stars SN1 and SN2. What can be said about the movement of these stars based on these spectra?</u></li>
    <img src="imgs/quiz_spectra.jpg" class="responsive">
        <p><a>(A)__</a>Both stars are moving toward the observer; however, SN2 is moving faster.</p>
        <p><a>(B)__</a>Both stars are moving toward the observer; however, SN2 is moving slower.</p>
        <p><a title="Correct! The color of the stars would shift toward the red end of the spectrum if they were moving away from the observer (called redshift) and toward the blue end of the spectrum if they were moving toward the observer (called blueshift). You can see that the emission lines in Section 2 (for SN1 and SN2) have shifted toward the red end of the spectrum and that SN2 has shifted farther than SN1.">(C)__</a>Both stars are moving away from the observer; however, SN2 is moving faster.</p>
        <p><a>(D)__</a>Both stars are moving away from the observer; however, SN2 is moving slower.</p>

    <li><u>Edwin Hubble created the figure below from a combination of his and Vesto Slipher's research data. What does the data in the figure show?</u></li>
        <img src="imgs/quiz_hubble.jpg" class="responsive">
        <p>(A)__The stars are receding from one another.</p>
        <p>(B)__The universe is expanding.</p>
        
    <p><a title="Correct! Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason plotted the distances they had calculated for 46 different galaxies against Slipher’s recession velocity and found a linear relationship in which the velocity of a star was directly proportional to its distance. Their graph showed that more distant galaxies were receding faster than closer ones, confirming the idea that the universe was expanding.">(C)__</a>The velocity of a star is directly proportional to its distance.</p>
        <p>(B)__Star brightness is a function of velocity.</p>

    <li><u>Einstein incorrectly believed that the universe was static because his theory of relativity predicted a static universe.</u></li>
        <p>(A)__True</p>
    <p><a title="Correct! Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicts that the universe must be expanding or contracting, not static. However, the dominant cultural belief at the time was that the universe was static. Because of Einstein's cultural biases, he refused to accept the idea of an expanding universe at first.">(B)__</a>False</p>
        
    <li><u>Which of the following statements BEST describes the process by which we have come to understand the age of the universe?</u></li>
        <p>(A)__Scientists have worked independently to test and answer unique questions using only their own data.</p>
        <p>(B)__Scientists have identified a single way to measure the age of the universe.</p>
        <p>(C)__The age of the universe cannot be known through scientific means.</p>    
    <p><a title="Correct! Scientists build on the work of others to create scientific knowledge. The age of the universe was estimated as a result of a long chain of research by multiple scientists using different methods over many decades. New studies, new technology, or new research methods might cause us to refine our estimate of the age of the universe in the future.">(D)__</a>Over time, newer studies have built upon, revised, and improved our understanding of the age of the universe.</p>
